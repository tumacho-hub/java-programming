  DEBUGGING USING INTELLIJ.
   When you have gub in your code , and you want to find and fix it,
   you need to do debug run.
    STEPS:
    1) put breakpoint by clicking on left side panel where line numbers are.
    if you do  not do this step, debug will not work.

    2) run as DEBUG (Bug icon)
      it will start the program and pause at the breakpoint line.
      3) go to panel below and click on console
      4) click on step over (broken arrow to go) step by step
      BENEFITS OF DEBUGGING
YOU CAN SEE THE FLOW OF THE EXECUTION OF YOUR CODE AND VARIABLES VALUES STEPS
BY STEP AND FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THR ISSUE.
